/**
 * The Grinch has hacked üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Santa Claus's workshop systems and has encoded the names of all the important files. 
 * Now the elves can't find the original files and they need your help to decipher the names.
 * 
 * Each file follows this format:
 *    It starts with a number (can contain any number of digits).
 *    Then has an underscore _.
 *    Continues with a file name and its extension.
 *    Ends with an extra extension at the end (which we don't need).
 * 
 * Keep in mind that the file names may contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), other underscores (_), and hyphens (-).
 * 
 * Your task is to implement a function that receives a string with the name of an encoded file and 
 * returns only the important part: the file name and its extension.
