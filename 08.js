/**
 * It's time to select the fastest reindeer for Santa's journeys! ðŸ¦ŒðŸŽ„
 * Santa Claus has organized exciting reindeer races to determine which ones are in the best shape.
 * 
 * Your task is to display each reindeer's progress on a snow track in isometric format.
 * 
 * The information you receive:
 * indices: An array of integers representing each reindeer's progress on the track
 * 0: The lane is empty
 * Positive number: The reindeer's current position from the beginning of the track
 * Negative number: The reindeer's current position from the end of the track.
 * length: The length of each lane
 * 
 * Return a string representing the race track:
 * 
 * Each lane has exactly length positions filled with snow (~)
 * Each reindeer is represented with the letter r
 * Lanes are numbered at the end with /1, /2, etc
 * The view is isometric, so the lower lanes are shifted to the right.
